This program runs the selftest available with the linux kernel source.
Compile and run the tests available at /tools/testing/selftests

Run test_kself:-
Supported <test type>:
-M (page merging)
-Z (zero pages merging)
-N (merging of pages in different NUMA nodes)
-U (page unmerging)
-C evaluate the time required to break COW of merged pages.
-P evaluate merging time and speed.
For this test, the size of duplicated memory area (in MiB) must be provided using -s option
-H evaluate merging time and speed of area allocated mostly with huge pages For this test, the size of duplicated memory area(in MiB)
must be provided using -s option

Inside kernel/kselftest.py.data/ksmtest.yaml we have below sections:
1. test_type   -> Kself supported test types.
2. Size        -> Size of duplicated memory area(in MiB) must be provided using -s option.
3. Dup_MM_Area -> Size of duplicated memory area (in MiB).

To run the -P and -H test types, the user must pass the value as shown below
Ex: test_type: "-H"
    Size: "-s"
    Dup_MM_Area: "100"
Note: The value of Dup_MM_Area depends on the use case.

To run the M-, -Z, -N, -U and -C test types, the user no need to pass the "Size" and "Dup_MM_Area" parameters.
Ex: test_type: "-M"
    Size: ""
    Dup_MM_Area: ""
