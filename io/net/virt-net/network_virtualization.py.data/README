Explanation of the input parameters:
lpar ---> lpar on which the Network virtualized interface needs to be added/deleted
server ---> name of the server which hosts the lpar
slot_num ---> slot number on which the Network virtualized interface will be added
vios_names ---> Comma separated name of the vios used to add/remove Network virtualized interface
sriov_adapters ---> Comma separated location code (DRC) of the the adapters that is assigned to the hypervisor
sriov_ports ---> Comma separated ports using which the Network virtualized interface will be added/removed
Ex: if the adapter has 2 ports and the Network virtualized interface should be added using Port 1, mention value as 0
else mention 2 if Network virtualized interface should be added using Port 1
bandwidth ---> The percentage of the ports bandwidth this Network virtualized interface is entitled to
device_ip ---> Ip to be configured for the added Network virtualized interface
netmask ---> netmask value for the added Network virtualized interface
peer_ip ---> Peer ip to which the added Network virtualized interface will ping to check for ping test
count ---> The number of times the unbind and bind test has to be executed
mac_id ---> MAC ID to be set for the vnic interface. This is needed for us to have control over interface name via interface file or udev rules

NOTE: The last device listed by "ip link show" will be used to configure and test the
